        \item Searched for new fundamental physics alongside 4000 scientists from over 50 countries by analyzing terabytes of record-breaking high-energy particle collisions at CERN's Large Hadron Collider
        \item Co-authored a \href{https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.112003}{research paper} constraining searches for a theorized elementary particle by placing the most stringent lower bound to date on the particle's mass at a 95\% confidence level
        \item Enhanced the sensitivity of an analysis to new physics by 10\% after training machine learning models on terabytes of noisy particle collision data
        \item Presented research at international conferences and participated in feedback cycles as both a reviewer and author of collaboration papers seeking publication
