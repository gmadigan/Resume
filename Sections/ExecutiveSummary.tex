I have 10 years of experience as a data scientist, where I have helped international scientific collaborations analyze terabytes of data and publish results in peer-reviewed journals. I have led a search for new physics at the highest-energy particle accelerator in the world by developing Python-based data processing frameworks, building and training ML models, and applying statistical methods that resulted in a peer-reviewed journal \href{https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.112003}{publication} I co-authored. My current \href{https://github.com/gmadigan/DataProjects}{projects} involving ML technologies include natural language processing and computer vision.
